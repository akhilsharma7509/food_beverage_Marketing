## About Project
This is Code Basics Resume Project Challenge. I worked on an exciting marketing project for CodeX, a well-known German beverage company entering the Indian market.They conducted a  Survey on Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities and recorded their response. I analyzed survey responses for their recently launched energy drink in 10 cities.
 ### my task
 My role was to analyze survey data from 10,000 participants and extract meaningful insights. This helped CodeX make informed marketing decisions, increase brand awareness, and enhance product development.

### Approach
 This data set contain survey of 10000 people from various citis.  I used MYSQL for conducting query and  MS Excel for  manual assessment of data and used POWERBI for data visualization  to extract meaningful
 insight from dataset

 ### Key finding
  1) About 60% are male consumer while 34% are of female consumer
  2) 19-45 age group of people consume more  as compare to other age group
  3) Consumers preferred energy drink with caffiene followed by vitamins,sugar,guarana
  4) only 20%  of people have positive brand impact, while taste experience is  3.3 on an average
  5) Tier-1 cities has more impact of energy drink as compared to Tier-2 cities ,so Tier-2 cities can be used for expansion.
  6) Price of energy drink can be in range of 50-150 , as more than 42% of people want Price between 50-99 and 32 % of people want price between 99-150.

### Recommendation
1) Collaborate with athlete (like virat kohli) with high influencer base  as it  is consumed more in sports/exercise time.
2) Enhance natural caffeine content and promote mental alertness by incorporating green tea extract and Guarana.
3) Focus More on Online ads, influencer marketing and short form of content(like insta reels,youtube shorts) as it is widely used
